# II.-Natural-Language-Processing-for-Disaster-tweets
Classification of tweets indicating Disasters from non-disasters 

* A machine learning model (in Python) that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones arenâ€™t. 
* GloVe word Embeddings to convert the words into its vector representations; aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space.
* Supervised learning models for prediction; Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision Trees, Voting Classification.
* Boosting (XGBoost) gives us the best result in all parameters.
